Let's take a look at the following example which shows how to sort a list of whole numbers:

# a list of numbers
my_numbers = [10, 8, 3, 22, 33, 7, 11, 100, 54]

#sort list in-place in ascending order
my_numbers.sort()

#print modified list
print(my_numbers)

#output

#[3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 22, 33, 54, 100]
